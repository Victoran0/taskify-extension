## What it isn't

- Scouter is not a translation tool. Its goal is to help you learn to use foreign languages independently.

## Usage

1. Set up your API Key and language.

2. Use the "Add to Anki" feature

    This is an optional step if you need to add knowledge to Anki, you need to complete the following steps:
    - Install the [Anki client](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
    - Install the [AnkiConnect plugin](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)

    The "Add to Anki" feature can only be used when the Anki client is open.

## Why develop Scouter?

I've been studying English since before ChatGPT was available, and I prefer to learn in real language environments, such as reading articles and participating in English community discussions. However, I had been unable to find a tool that could analyze and explain the grammar of target sentences until I encountered ChatGPT. Although ChatGPT can help me analyze and practice grammar, I still need to manually copy and paste sentences and switch to the ChatGPT window to ask questions each time.
